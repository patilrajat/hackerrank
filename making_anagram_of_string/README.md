Sample Input
cde
abc

Sample Output
4
Explanation

We delete the following characters from our two strings to turn them into anagrams of each other:

Remove d and e from cde to get c.
Remove a and b from abc to get c.
We must delete 4 characters to make both strings anagrams, so we print 4 on a new line.
